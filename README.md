I used Power BI for visualizing the insights from Sales Data. Before creating this Sales Data Visualization Dashboard, I explored and learned key data visualization concepts and techniques. I studied the purpose and application of widely used charts such as Line Charts, Histograms, Bar Charts, Scatterplots, and Keycards. I also learned about the Data-Ink Ratio and its role in improving visual clarity by reducing unnecessary elements. Additionally, I gained knowledge about color palettes, their types, and how to choose appropriate color schemes to enhance the effectiveness of different chart types.
With these concepts in mind, I applied my understanding to develop a clear and informative dashboard. Overall, this helped me analyze the important details and apply them to design a clean and informative dashboard
